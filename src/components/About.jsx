            I know you are scared, scared of yourself, scared about "what will i
            do in life" , scared about "I never make my parents happy" , scared
            about "they dont deserve the kid like me" , scared about "they are
            doing their best for me , and i am not giving them something back
            from my side". But its okay , its okay to feel this way , this is
            not your fault , because I know you dont want this, you are not this
            , the surroundings , the environmental exposure you got , or the
            things you feel has made you to think like this.Remember if god sent
            you on ðŸŒŽ , then God must have a purpose , a good purpose that even
            God himslef can not do.So you were his choice to make that purpose
            done ! . Beleive in God , Give yourself to him , put your soul ,
            body all in front of him,and tell him that now you have to become
            the "Sails Of My Ship". Now i will be flowen to the direction ,
            where you will take me.{" "}
