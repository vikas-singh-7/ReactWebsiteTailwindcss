eye completed

lets rotate eyes

first we will move eyes on the base of mouse move

so we need mouse direction ,,, we do window.addEventListner("mouseMove",(e)=>{
e.clientX and Clisent y we get the poastion of mouse
})

now we need to find the center of the scree which we do by window.innerheight/2 and window.innerWidth/2

and we now find the angle of the mouuse from its postion like where the mouse is at top right or wehre

so we do delta x = window.ClientX-window.innerwidth/2
we now got delta x and now we will change it in degrers like in how much degrees it is
so we do is ... we take the radians ,,,(radian is the df btween the center and position of screen)  
and when we get the degrees angle we move our eye div
by trasnlate rotate (deg)
